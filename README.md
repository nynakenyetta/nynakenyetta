I am currently pursuing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the University of Birmingham Dubai. As a biomedical engineering graduate, with honours from Queen Mary University, I am passionate about healthcare related projects. With the MedTech industry developing so quickly, I do not want to be left behind. Because of this, I am learning about Python, C#, Unity, machine learning, deep learning, and microcontrollers.

Skills: Python / MATLAB / Arduino / C# / HTML / CSS

- ðŸ”­ My most recent project, for my undergraduate thesis, was to develop a pressure matrix sensor for a myoelectric prosthetic hand 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to process EMG signals using machine learning techniques
